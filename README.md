### Project setup

If you handle multiple dependencies in your project is better to add a *conanfile.txt*
    
    [requires]
    boost/1.72.20@R3v3nX/testing

    [options]
    
    [generators]
    cmake

Complete the installation of requirements for your project running:

    conan install . --build=missing 

Project setup installs the library (and all his dependencies) and generates the files *conanbuildinfo.txt* and *conanbuildinfo.cmake* with all the paths and variables that you need to link with your dependencies.
